# General Introduction

Our general philosophy with respect to any form of annotation is that it should be descriptive
rather than based on analyses to facilitate future research in any area. 


This general introduction provides examples of our general annotation principles to make annotators and
correctors familiar with our general annotation protocols and to provide background
regarding annotation decisions. It also gives detailed information about how to deal with
verbs in particular. Plenty of examples, some with, some without tags (depending on which
source they're from) are given throughout. They are numbered per section.


For segmentation we split words as much as possible and we create sentence boundaries
between main clauses and with direct speech. See section on Sentence Segmentation. 

For POS tagging, we apply morphological information in a conservative manner to make sure
that we can capture the origin of constructions that have changed over time. 

For example,
complex postpositions, as shown here are split and all elements are tagged separately:

 སྒང་ལ་ “ on top” (see n.rel section)</br>
བུ་ n.count</br>
མཚམས་ n.count</br>
ཀྱི་ case.gen</br>
སྒང་ n.rel</br>
ལ་ case.all</br>
ལྟད་མོ་ n.count</br>
ལ་ case.all</br>
གཏོང་མཁན་ n.v.pres</br>
ཁྱོད་ p.pers</br>
མིན་པ་ n.v.fut.n.v.pres.min</br>
སུ་ p.interrog</br>
མང་ v.pres</br>
