Count noun. Lexical nouns head a noun phrase and can have nominal suffixes such as -མོ་ ,
- པོ་ and -བུ་. We treat a - པ་ or - བ་ as part of the preceding word, regardless of the part-of-
speech of the preceding word. Sanskrit terms, e.g. ཀུན་ཏུ་རྒྱུ་ 'parivrājaka', are treated as a noun
together because it looks like a verb phrase, but functions syntactically as a noun.

In general, when two nouns occur in succession they are understood as a compound; the
dvandva compound ཕ་མ་ 'parents' is treated as one noun rather than two ( ཕ་ 'father' and མ་
'mother') and the tatpuruṣa compound ཁྱིམ་བདག་ 'householder' is likewise treated as one noun
rather than two ( ཁྱིམ་ 'home' and བདག་ 'lord'). When an adjective precedes its head this is also
treated as a compound. Thus, because དུག་བཙན་པོ་ would be the expected order for 'mighty
poison', we treat བཙན་དུག་ 'mighty poison' (vol. 74, page 147a) as a single word.

Apposition is the one category of exceptions when the concatenation of two nouns is not
treated as a compound. An example of this type is the two words བུ་ཁྱེའུ་ in the following
sentence:

(63) དེའ ་ ི ཚེ་ཡུལ་དེ་ན་ཁྱིམ་བདག་ཅིག་ལ་བུ་ཁྱེའུ ་ཞིག་བཙས་ན། 'At that time, in that land, when a child,
a son, was born to a householder'.

Rather than understanding ཁྱེའུ་ as an adjective modifying བུ་, or taking བུ་ཁྱེའུ་ as one word, the
second word simply sits after the first one to add greater specificity. The reason to not treat
apposition as compounding is because apposition occurs with proper nouns. For example, in
the sentence:

(64) དེའི་ཚེ་ན་རྒྱལ་པོ་གསལ་རྒྱལ་གྱི་བཙུན་མོ་ཆེན་པོ་ཧབར་ལི་ཞེས་བྱ་བ་ལ་བུ་མོ་ཞིག་བཙས་ནས་ 'At that
time a daughter was born to Ḥbar-li, the main queen of king Prasenajit',


In (64), རྒྱལ་པོ་ 'king' and གསལ་རྒྱལ་ 'Prasenajit' are in apposition; to unite the two as a compound
would lead to unintuitive, unwieldy, and therefore have unacceptable consequences.
