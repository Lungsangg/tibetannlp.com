Cardinal number. Cardinal numbers are tagged num.card. In higher numbers each
component digit is tagged separately to provide more insight into the internal structure.
When a numeral follows a noun we regard the two as separate words. In addition to obvious
cases like མི་ ལྔ་ 'five men', we also treat དཀོན་མཆོག་གསུམ་ 'triratna' as two words. We treat ཕྲག་ as a
cardinal number. There are occasions when the morphology of a word suggests that it might
contain a numeral (e.g. མངོན་སུམ 'real', ཕུན་སུམ་ཚོགས་ 'marvellous'), but there is no reason to see
such cases as synchronically analysable. Numbers that end with - པོ་ are also tagged
num.card. Derivatives of numerals are treated according to the function they have in the
sentence, thus གཅིག་པ་ 'sole' is an adjective, གཉི་ག་ 'both' is an indefinite pronoun, etc.
